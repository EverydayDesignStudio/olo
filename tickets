>> slider speed, investigate proper pwm method

Currently, slider often overshoots target value at unpredictable amount
this could position the slider in an incorrect 'segment' on the selcted
timeframe... ~check if ease in-out is feasible

>> static load
===============
At times, the QT1010 will continuously sense a touch (especially when
touching the mounting screws on the front panel). I suspect this has to
do with a static charge on the metallic components of the motor-fader.
Most likely, this was the raison d'etre of the capacitor connecting The
electrode to ground. However, with the 0.1uF cap that is indicated in The
circuit diagram, the QT1010 does not work properly.

When the slider knob hits the mounting screws it also sends a signal to
the QT1010!!!
